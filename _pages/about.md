I am Lexiao Lai 赖乐潇, an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php) at the University of Hong Kong. My research is in nonconvex optimization, applied semialgebraic geometry, and data science. I received my Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in May 2024.
